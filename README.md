# Weight Lifter
Made by Mujtaba Zahidi, 2022.

## Objective
As a weight lifter, making sure to correctly record the exercises that I am doing with the recorded number of repetitions (reps) and sets is needed. With this application, I will be able to enter the type of exercise, the number of sets, the number of reps and any other miscellaneous notes.

## Tools
The tools used are:
* VSCode for the IDE
    * Extensions:
        * ...
* Figma for design
* React with custom CSS for front-end
* Node.js with Express for back-end
* PostgreSQL for database

## Design Decisions
The following are designs that should be made for the front-end.
### Sample Exercise Page
This example shows how a page for a specific exercise day would look like:\

## Software Architecture Decisions
We will employ a basic REST API interface between the front-end client and the back-end service. The front-end client is made up of React with a custom CSS code. While, the back-end service is made with Express.js in Node.js.
